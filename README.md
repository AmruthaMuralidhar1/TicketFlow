# ðŸŽ« TicketFlow: Create, Track, and Resolve Support Issues with Ease

**TicketFlow** is a cloud-based support ticket management application built as part of my Cloud Computing course. It allows users to create, track, and resolve customer support tickets with ease. The app provides real-time ticket status updates, priority management, and analytics to help support teams stay organized and efficient.

- **Create Tickets**: Users can submit new support tickets, including issue description and priority level.
